# IUEA-OOP1
## Programming Diagnostics for the OOP1 course at IUEA.

The programs in this repository are designed to correspond to the introductory Object-Oriented Programming course 
at the International University of East Africa in Kampala, Uganda.  These sample programs demonstrate good style 
while introducing all the topics that a novice programmer needs to master in an introductory course.  They are 
designed to be read through and then interacted with to explore the relationship between the output a student sees
and the code creating that output.  Most weeks feature exercises to challenge students and help them master
these basic concepts.  Occasionally the more advanced topics do not include these exercises and students are 
encouraged to attempt to replicate the code on their own and apply the concepts to other programs they have seen.
