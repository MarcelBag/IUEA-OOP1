public class Hello {

        System.out.println("Hello World");

        // That's it, that's all of Hello World! But here are some things to
        // try that will give you a better understanding of what is happening.
        // You should stop and run the code now to see the output.

        // *** EXERCISES ***

        // First try copying and pasting "System.out.println("Hello World");"
        // below this comment.  How does the output change?



        // Second, try changing the text "Hello World" to something else.  Make
        // sure to keep the quotation marks around what you write.



        // Finally, try removing the "ln" from the first command above,
        // "System.out.println("Hello World");"  How does this alter the output
        // of the program?  What do you think "ln" stands for?
