ANSWER KEY

DIAGNOSTIC STUDENT EXAM — OOP I (v1 June 12, 2017)

Part I:

1) 3x = 9

   What is the value of x? (3)

2) 2x + 3y = 8
   -x + 4y = 7

   What are the values of x and y? (x = 1, y = 2)


3) You have 6 exams to take and each exam takes 55 minutes. 

   a) How many minutes do you need to complete all exams? (330 minutes)
   b) How many hours do you need to complete all exams (to the nearest tenth of an hour)? (5.5 hours)

4) Examine the following order of letters: A,B,C,D,Z,Y,X. Let the “first” letter refer to “A”, the second to “B”, etc.

   a) What is the order of letters if the fourth letter is moved to the front of the order? (D,A,B,C,Z,Y,X)
   b) What is the order of letters if the third, sixth and seventh letters are removed? (A,B,D,Z)
   c) What is the order of letters if the third and seventh letters are removed, then the letters are put in alphabetical order? (A,B,D,Y,Z)

5) Assume all log functions are in base 10 (ln functions are in base e). Please find the answer to the following questions.

   a) log(10000) = ? (4)
   b) log(0) = ? (undef)
   c) ln(e^2) = ? (2)
   d) ln(1) = ? (0)

6) A = 4. B = 3A and C = (5/4)B. If D is two times B plus C, what is D? (39)

7) What is the slope of the line between (-5,6) and (3, -10)? (-2)

8) Assume all log functions are in base N. Simplify the equations to be some function of N. Example: (N^2)^(1/2) = N.

   a) log(N) = ? (1)
   b) N^2*log(N^2) = ? (2N^2)
   c) N*N*N*(1/2)*log(N) = ? ((1/2)log(N)*N^3)




Part II:

1) In Java, what type of variable is “aaa”? (String)

2) Please read the following Java code: (all questions refer to directly after program termination)

	int x = 25;

   What is x called? (variable)
   What is the value of x? (25)
   What does int mean? (integer)

3) Please read the following Java code: (all questions refer to directly after program termination)

	int height1 = 12;
	int height2 = 9;
	int total = height1 + height2

   What is the value of total? (21)

4) Please read the following Java code: (all questions refer to directly after program termination)

	int y = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		y += 1
	}

   What is the value of y? (10)
   What is the value of i? (10)

5) Please read the following Java code: (all questions refer to directly after program termination)

	String str = “ABCDEFG”
	str = str.substring(2)

   What is the value of str? (“CDEFG”)

6) What does static mean in the context of Java programming? (The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.)

7) Please read the following Java code:

   public static int function(int num1, int num2) {
	int result = 0;

	result = num1 * num2;
	result = result % 5;
	result *= num1;

	return result;
   }

   What would be the return value of function (6, 3)? (18)

8) What does type casting mean and do? Give an appropriate example. (Casting means taking an Object of one particular type and “turning it into” another Object type. Example: (int) ‘a’ would return the ascii value of the character ‘a’, which is an integer).

9) What is the object Wrapper class for int called? For double? (Integer, Double)

10) Please read the following Java code: (all questions refer to directly after program termination)

	int check = 5;
	boolean Mark = False;
	int num1;

	int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 5, 8, 5};

	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		num1 += a[i];
		if (a[i] = check) {
			Mark = !Mark
		}
		int b = a[1];
  	}


   a) What is the length of a? (5)
   b) What is the value of Mark? (False)
   c) What is the value of b? (2)
   d) Why can’t a be equal to b? (a is of type array, b is of type int)
   e) What is the value of num1? (21)
