public class Basic {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// The following line is called a "statement" and everything within the
		// brackets opened in the line above is called a "block".
		System.out.println("Welcome to your second program!");

		// Everything up to here should look familiar.  You may have noticed
		// the file names of these programs always match the first line of real
		// code, "public class Basic {", where this file is "Basic.java".  Be
		// sure to follow this rule to make the structure of your program clear
		// for others who might use it.

		// You should also notice that after certain lines there are brackets,
		// and that if a bracket is opened, it is always closed.  Your code will
		// not run if this is not true.  You can experiment with which pieces of
		// code are necessary for this program to run, but you will find that 
		// almost everything here is required.

		System.out.print("This is a place for experimentation, ");
		System.out.println("and you should take advantage of that!");
		System.out.println("See what you can break and then fix.");

		// Finally, every line (almost) in Java ends in either a bracket or a
		// semicolon so your code should follow this rule too.  Brackets are for
		// opening and closing blocks of code.  Semicolons are for ending 
		// statements.

		// *** EXERCISES ***

		// As an exercise, you might try retyping this program into a new file
		// on your own computer.  This will help with memorizing the structure.
